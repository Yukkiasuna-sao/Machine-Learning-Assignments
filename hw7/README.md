1. LSTM.ipynb is the solution to question 1, which is to mimic Russell's writing styles and generate texts.
2. CNNs for image colorization (K=4).ipynb is the solution to question 2. Here we use 4 colors clustered by KMeans to colorize the images.
3. CNNs for image colorization (K=16).ipynb is the solution to extra practice of question 2. Here we use 16 colors clustered by KMeans to colorize the images.
4. CNNs for image colorization (K=24).ipynb is the solution to extra practice of question 2. Here we use 24 colors clustered by KMeans to colorize the images.
